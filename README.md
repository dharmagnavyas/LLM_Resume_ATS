## Overview
This project generates and groups ATS (Applicant Tracking System) keywords for the role of a Product Manager using OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The primary goal is to ensure the generated keywords are accurate and contextually relevant, and that they can be easily extended to other occupational roles.

## Features
- **Keyword Generation:** Generates a list of 500 unique ATS keywords associated with Product Management.
- **Keyword Grouping:** Groups the generated keywords by similar meaning using AI.
- **Scalability:** The logic is designed to be scalable and extendable to other roles.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key

## Usage
1. **Set up your OpenAI API key:**
   Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` in the code with your actual OpenAI API key.
   ```python
   openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   Execute the `resume.py` script to generate and group the keywords.

3. **Output:**
   The script will print the generated keywords and their groups to the console. It will also save the grouped keywords to a file named `grouped_keywords.json`.

## Output
